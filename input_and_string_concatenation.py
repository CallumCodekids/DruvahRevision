#the INPUT FUNCTION is very similar to the print function in that it also outputs the text inside of it to the terminal
#however, unlike the print function the INPUT FUNCTION
#takes only a single STRING as an argument, rather than any number of any values
#asks the string as a question to the user and BLOCKS the execution of the rest of the program until the question has been answered
#by tying in the terminal and hitting enter
#and RETURNS the answer to the question, making the call to the INPUT FUNCTION produce the answer as a value after the input function has finished execution
#STRINGS can be concatenated (added to the end of each other) using the + operator and duplicated using the * OPERATOR
